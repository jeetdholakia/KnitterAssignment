# KnitterAssignment

This project follows MVVM guidelines set by google. The package structure reflects the architectural decisions.

I have used the following libraries: 

Dagger-Android(DI)

Room ORM (Data Layer)

Coroutines (Async execution)

Retrofit (Network layer)

RxJava

Android Paging Lib

#### Android Jetpack Libraries - 
ViewModel, Lifecycle, KTX (VM Layer)


# Installation
Please install the APK provided in the zip on any phone or emulator. It is a debug build which will not require any certificate signing.

# What could have been done better, given more time resources
Cleaner DI on network layer
Completely optimized execution of Android Paging Library
Better global server error handling mechanism
